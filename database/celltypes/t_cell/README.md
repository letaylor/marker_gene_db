> The T cell signatures for cytotoxicity (GNLY, GZMB, GZMK, IFNG, NKG7), co-inhibition (CTLA4, PDCD1, TIGIT, HAVCR2, LAG3, BTLA, PDPN, CD160, GP49A, LILRB4, CD274, CD200, CD244, PILRA, SIRPB1, LAIR1, CEACAM1, KLRA7, KLRA3. KLRA9, PTGER4, KLRD1, KLRC1, PROCR), and co-stimulation (CD28, CD226, TNFRSF4, TNFRSF9, ICOS, CD27, TNFSF14, CD80, TNFSF4, CD86, TNFSF11, CD276, CD40LG, TNFRSF18) were derived from known markers.
