> The expression of the following genes was used to define a crypt-axis score: SEPP1, CEACAM7, PLAC8, CEACAM1, TSPAN1, CEACAM5, CEACAM6, IFI27, DHRS9, KRT20, RHOC, CD177, PKIB, HPGD and LYPD8. For each gene, we normalized expression across all cells to a range between 0 and 1, to ensure that the contribution of individual genes to the score was not weighted by baseline expression. The final crypt-axis score for each cell was then defined as the sum of all normalized expression values.
